This folder contains the C reimplementation of cppcms's json to demostrate that
with the help of `cee-std` the C implementation is simpler and easier to reason 
than the original C++ implementation.  

The COPYRIGHT of the algorithm and some 
code belongs to Artyom Beilis (Tonkikh) <artyomtnk@yahoo.com>


The folder contains code/algorithm that are shamelessly stolen from these great works:

CPPMS:  https://github.com/artyom-beilis/cppcms/blob/master/src/json.cpp 
Stonky: https://github.com/antirez/stonky/blob/main/stonky.c
